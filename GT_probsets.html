        It's increasingly apparent that group theory is an exceptionally weak area for me, mathematically, so I've decided to teach myself some by way of textbooks and lecture notes. These problem sets and final exam are my attempt to understand these readings: you'll find all of them attached below, with solutions. Beneath this paragraph, I've also affixed a list of prerequisites with which you'll be able to tackle each problem set; obviously, the final exam covers all of these. If you desire a wee bit more detail, you'll lastly find a precis on this page which outlines the content that I've read. The first half broadly resembles the Group Theory course syllabus, as taught at the University of Edinburgh in the 2025/26 academic year (http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/25-26/dpt/cxmath10079.html) References reside at the bottom of the page.

        <b> How do I use these?</b> I don't care. If you'd like to approach these exercises as a `university-style lecture-taught course', I'd suggest marking each problem set holistically out of 20 points and dividing your result by two so that each problem set is worth 10%. The final exam should then be marked slightly more strictly, out of 100 points; divide your result again by two so that the final exam is worth 50%.
